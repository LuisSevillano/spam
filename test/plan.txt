Goal:
- save to pic in multiple steps while zooming in
- potentially reuse a lot of the code base
- how to do feature to feature zooms? manually?

Plan:
- basic CanvasMap class:
    * setFeatures (takes feature array as usual, for dynamicpaint)
    * setZoom
    * setTranslate
    * setBackground(zoom, translate, image), always uses this background from that point
    * paint()
    * hover/click handling?
    * rtrees should be created before to time it for added/removed elements

- static CanvasMap class, just a wrapper for CanvasMap class

- zoomable classes more complicated
