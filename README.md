# spam
spam.js is a small library to create modern [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) maps with [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3). It supports static and zoomable maps with automatic centering and retina support.

It doesn't tie you to a custom framework, so you're still in charge of painting everything. For making that easy it divides the process into several stages (`prepaint`, `paintfeature`, `postpaint`, `dynamicpaint`).

The library supports custom projections, `d3.geo` path generators and multiple features in the same map.

## Getting started
spam.js depends on [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), [rbush](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson).

Due to a bug on D3 and TopoJSON you'll need to use our forks. Grab them [here](https://github.com/lukasappelhans/d3) and [here](https://github.com/lukasappelhans/topojson). We are expecting a PR soon.

Here's the most basic map you can do:

```javascript
d3.json("map.json", function(error, d) {
    topojson.presimplify(d)

    var map = new StaticCanvasMap({
        element: "body",
        data: [{
                features: topojson.feature(d, d.objects["map"]),
                paintfeature: function(parameters, d) {
                    parameters.context.stroke()
                }
            }
        ]
    })
    map.init()
})
```

And that's it! A simple, static map in just a few lines of code! It will be automagically projected and centered in your container, nothing else needed.

## API
spam.js exports two classes: StaticCanvasMap and ZoomableCanvasMap. The only difference between them is that the latter provides a *zoom*-function which takes a feature as parameter.

Both constructors take a parameters object, while both of them accept the same members.

### element
This can be any term that works with d3.select() and is used to lookup the element that is used as the parent of the DOM-elements the spam.js-code will create.

```javascript
element: ".container"
```

### width
Takes a value with the desired width of the map.

```javascript
width: 960
```

### height
Takes a value with the desired height of the map.

```javascript
height: 500
```

### zoomScaleFactor
Takes a value between `0` and `1` which sets the zooming factor of the map.

```javascript
zoomScaleFactor: 0.5
```

### projection
You can specify a projection to override the default (mercator). Declare it the same way as you would in D3, as it supports the usual stuff (`translate`, `center`, `scale`). You can also just provide the name of the projection and spam will try to center and scale it.

```javascript
projection: d3.geo.conicConformalSpain()
    .translate([960 / 2, 500 / 2])
    .scale(1000)
```

### data
This is an array of objects that define what will be rendered by spam.js. spam.js can render multiple datasets, the first element in the array gets painted first. The only mandatory property is *features* which takes a [FeatureCollection](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/API-Reference#feature).

```javascript
data: [{
    input: options,
    input: options
}]
```

You can also nest different objects if you need to paint multiple maps.

```javascript
data: [{
        input: options,
        input: options
    },
    {
        input: options,
        input: options
    }
]
```

#### features
The TopoJSON feature you want to map, with its object name.

```javascript
features: topojson.feature(d, d.objects["map"]),
```

#### prepaint
Fires up before `paintfeature` and is useful for creating elements that only need to be painted once, as [graticules](http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/GISDictionary/term/graticule).

``javascript
prepaint: function(parameters, d) {
    // your code goes here
}
```

#### paintfeature
The main painting event. This is where you can use canvas to paint the stroke of your map or fill it with colors to create a choropleth.

``javascript
paintfeature: function(parameters, d) {
    // your code goes here
}
```

#### postpaint
It gets called once after `paintfeature` is done. You can use this event to create objects on the top of the map, as labels, annotations, circles or bubbles.

``javascript
postpaint: function(parameters, d) {
    // your code goes here
}
```

#### dynamicpaint
Gets called everytime the mouse is inside the map. It takes `parameters` and `hover`, which contains the properties of the current hovered object. This is indeed useful for creating tooltips.

``javascript
dynamicpaint: function(parameters, hover) {
    // your code goes here
}
```

#### click
Captures click events.

```javascript
click: function(parameters, d) {
    // zooming example
    parameters.map.zoom(d)
}
```
