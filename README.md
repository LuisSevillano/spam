# spam
spam.js is a small library to create modern [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) maps with [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3). It makes it easy to create static or zoomable maps with automatic centering and retina resolution. Custom projections, `d3.geo` path generators and multiple map features are also supported.

It doesn't tie you to a framework, you're still in charge of painting everything. For doing that it divides the map rendering into several stages (`prepaint`, `paintfeature`, `postpaint`, `dynamicpaint`).

## Getting started
spam.js depends on [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3), [rbush](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson).

Due to a bug on D3 and TopoJSON you'll need to use our forks. Grab them [here](https://github.com/lukasappelhans/d3) and [here](https://github.com/lukasappelhans/topojson). We are expecting a PR soon.

Clone the repository (or download) the zip and include `spam.js` after D3, TopoJSON and rbush in your website.

````html
<script src="spam.js"></script>
```

Here's the most basic map you can do:

```javascript
d3.json("map.json", function(error, d) {
    topojson.presimplify(d)

    var map = new StaticCanvasMap({
        element: "body",
        data: [{
                features: topojson.feature(d, d.objects["map"]),
                paintfeature: function(parameters, d) {
                    parameters.context.stroke()
                }
            }
        ]
    })
    map.init()
})
```

And that's it! A simple, static map in just a few lines of code! It will be automagically projected and centered in your container, nothing else needed.

## API
spam.js exports two classes: StaticCanvasMap and ZoomableCanvasMap. The only difference between them is that the latter provides a *zoom*-function which takes a feature as parameter.

Both constructors take a parameters object, while both of them accept the same members.

### element
This can be any term that works with d3.select() and is used to lookup the element that is used as the parent of the DOM-elements the spam.js-code will create.

```javascript
element: ".container"
```

### width
Takes a value with the desired width of the map.

```javascript
width: 960
```

### height
Takes a value with the desired height of the map.

```javascript
height: 500
```

### zoomScaleFactor
Takes a value between `0` and `1` which sets the zooming factor of the map.

```javascript
zoomScaleFactor: 0.5
```

### projection
You can specify a projection to override the default (mercator). Declare it the same way as you would in D3, as it supports the usual stuff (`translate`, `center`, `scale`). You can also just provide the name of the projection and spam will try to center and scale it.

It supports custom projections, so you are able to use a projection from [`d3.geo.projection`](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection/) or [`d3-composite-projections`](https://github.com/rveciana/d3-composite-projections) if you load them before:

```javascript
projection: d3.geo.robinson()
    .translate([960 / 2, 500 / 2])
    .scale(1000)
```

### data
This is an array of objects that define what will be rendered by spam.js. spam.js can render multiple datasets, the first element in the array gets painted first. The only mandatory property is *features* which takes a [FeatureCollection](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/API-Reference#feature).

```javascript
data: [{
    property: input,
    property: input
}]
```

You can also nest different objects if you need to paint multiple maps.

```javascript
data: [{
        property: input,
        property: input
    },
    {
        property: input,
        property: input
    }
]
```

<a name="features" href="README.md#features">#</a> **features**: topojson.feature(d, d.objects["map"]).

The TopoJSON feature you want to map, with its object name.

<a name="prepaint" href="README.md#prepaint">#</a> **prepaint**: function(parameters, d) {}

Fires up before `paintfeature` and is useful for creating elements that only need to be painted once, as [graticules](http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/GISDictionary/term/graticule).

<a name="paintfeature" href="README.md#paintfeature">#</a> **paintfeature**: function(parameters, d) {}

The main painting event. This is where you can use canvas to paint the stroke of your map or fill it with colors to create a choropleth.

<a name="postpaint" href="README.md#postpaint">#</a> **postpaint**: function(parameters, d) {}

It gets called once after `paintfeature` is done. You can use this event to create objects on the top of the map, as labels, annotations, circles or bubbles.

<a name="dynamicpaint" href="README.md#dynamicpaint">#</a> **dynamicpaint**: function(parameters, hover) {}

Gets called everytime the mouse is inside the map. It takes `parameters` and `hover`, which contains the properties of the current hovered object. This is indeed useful for creating tooltips.

<a name="click" href="README.md#click">#</a> **click**: function(parameters, d) {}

Captures click events.
